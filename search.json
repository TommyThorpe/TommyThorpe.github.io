    "title": "Is Lamar Jackson the Greatest Dual-Theat QB of All-Time?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The dual-threat quarterback has gone from a trend to a necessity in today’s NFL. Lamar Jackson may be the truest embodiment of the dual threat quarterback ever, which leads to a new question: Is he the greatest? \nA stigma against many dual threat quarterbacks is they naturally rely slightly less on their arms because of their talent and creativity they present with their legs. Jackson entered the 2018 draft with his critics discussing this exact situation. Some scouts and team officials even called for Jackson to switch to wide receiver so he could take full advantage of his athletic abilities. Would Jackson work out as an NFL quarterback?\n\nShort answer: he can. \n\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(janitor)\n\nrawqb &lt;- read_csv(\"qbs19752024.csv\")\n\n\ndualthreatqbs &lt;- rawqb |&gt; \n  filter(Player %in% c(\"Lamar Jackson\", \"Cam Newton\", \"Russell Wilson\", \"Steve Young\", \"John Elway\", \"Randall Cunningham\", \"Michael Vick\",\"Jalen Hurts\", \"Donovan McNabb\", \"Josh Allen\")) |&gt; \n  group_by(Player) |&gt; \n  arrange(desc(Player))\n\nnewdualthreat &lt;- dualthreatqbs |&gt; \n  group_by(Player) |&gt; \n  summarise(\n    CareerPassTD = sum(TD),\n    CareerInt = sum(Int)\n  ) |&gt; \n  mutate(CareerTDIntRatio = CareerPassTD/CareerInt) |&gt; \n  arrange(desc(CareerTDIntRatio))\n\nlj8 &lt;- newdualthreat |&gt; \n  filter(Player == \"Lamar Jackson\")\n\nggplot()+\n  geom_bar(data=newdualthreat, aes(x=reorder(Player, CareerTDIntRatio), weight=CareerTDIntRatio),fill=\"lightgrey\")+\n  geom_bar(data=lj8, aes(x=reorder(Player, CareerTDIntRatio), weight=CareerTDIntRatio), fill=\"purple\")+\n  coord_flip()+ \n  labs(\n    x=\"Player\", \n    y=\"Career Touchdown to Interception Ratio\", \n    title=\"Which dual-threat QB protects the ball best?\", \n    subtitle=\"Jackson's touchdown to interception ratio tops all of the other notable dual threat QBs\", \n    caption=\"Source: Pro Football Reference | By Thomas Thorpe\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal()+\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince his arrival in 2018, the Louisville product leads the dual threat classification passing touchdown to interception ratio: an important statistic that measures a quarterback’s best and worst deliverables. How often a quarterback can deliver a good result compared to a back one is an essential metric when evaluating their play.\n\nAlthough interception ratio is a fantastic measurable for quarterback play, there’s more to football than just touchdowns and turnovers. Sometimes a team just needs a standard first down. Sometimes a team just needs a clutch completion on third and long. How often a quarterback is completing passes is important to individual and team success and is one of the most common evaluating factors to quarterback play. \nJackson shows out compared to other dual threat quarterbacks.\n\n\nCode\ndualthreatqblarge &lt;- rawqb |&gt; \n  filter(Player %in% c(\"Lamar Jackson\", \"Cam Newton\", \"Russell Wilson\", \"Steve Young\", \"John Elway\", \"Randall Cunningham\", \"Michael Vick\",\"Jalen Hurts\", \"Donovan McNabb\", \"Justin Fields\", \"Kyler Murray\", \"Deshaun Watson\", \"Patrick Mahomes\", \"Aaron Rodgers\", \"Josh Allen\", \"Steve McNair\", \"Colin Kaepernick\")) |&gt; \n  group_by(Player) |&gt; \n  summarise(\n    CareerGames = sum(G),\n    CareerPassAtt = sum(Att),\n    CareerPassComp = sum(Cmp)\n  ) |&gt; \n  mutate(CareerCompPct = CareerPassComp/CareerPassAtt) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(Player))\n\nmurray &lt;- rawqb |&gt; \n  filter(Player == \"Kyler Murray\") |&gt; \n group_by(Player) |&gt; \n  summarise(\n    CareerGames = sum(G),\n    CareerPassAtt = sum(Att),\n    CareerPassComp = sum(Cmp)\n  ) |&gt; \n    mutate(CareerCompPct = CareerPassComp/CareerPassAtt) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(Player))\n\nrodgers &lt;- rawqb |&gt; \n  filter(Player == \"Aaron Rodgers\") |&gt; \n group_by(Player) |&gt; \n  summarise(\n    CareerGames = sum(G),\n    CareerPassAtt = sum(Att),\n    CareerPassComp = sum(Cmp)\n  ) |&gt; \n    mutate(CareerCompPct = CareerPassComp/CareerPassAtt) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(Player))\n\nlj8pass &lt;- rawqb |&gt; \n  filter(Player == \"Lamar Jackson\") |&gt; \n group_by(Player) |&gt; \n  summarise(\n    CareerGames = sum(G),\n    CareerPassAtt = sum(Att),\n    CareerPassComp = sum(Cmp)\n  ) |&gt; \n    mutate(CareerCompPct = CareerPassComp/CareerPassAtt) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(Player)) \n\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(\n    data=dualthreatqblarge, \n    aes(x=CareerGames, y=CareerCompPct), \n    color=\"grey\", \n    alpha=.7) + \n  geom_point(\n    data=lj8pass, \n    aes(x=CareerGames, y=CareerCompPct), \n    color=\"purple\")+\n  geom_point(\n    data=murray, \n    aes(x=CareerGames, y=CareerCompPct), \n    color=\"red\")+\n   geom_point(\n    data=rodgers, \n    aes(x=CareerGames, y=CareerCompPct), \n    color=\"darkgreen\")+\n  theme_minimal()+\n  labs(\n    x=\"Career Games\", \n    y=\"Completion Percentage\", \n    title=\"Who's the most efficient QB in the air?\", \n    subtitle=\"Jackson ranks fourth among completion percentage among dual-threat QBs.\", \n    caption=\"Source: Pro Football Reference | By Thomas Thorpe\"\n    )+\n   theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )+\n  geom_text(aes(x=125, y=.6490, label=\"Lamar Jackson\"), color=\"purple\")+\n  geom_text(aes(x=100, y=.6720, label=\"Kyler Murray\"), color=\"red\")+\n  geom_text(aes(x=240, y=.6575, label=\"Aaron Rodgers\"), color=\"darkgreen\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscussing rushing statistics is a must when evaluating and comparing dual threat quarterbacks. Not every dual threat quarterback is equal. Some run more than others. Some run longer than others.

    "text": "The NFL is officially in it’s newest era of top-end play at the quarterback position. The battles of Peyton Manning, Tom Brady, Drew Brees, Matt Ryan, Phillip Rivers and others are officially over. The position moved in a younger almost instantly, with players such as Patrick Mahomes, Lamar Jackson, Josh Allen and Joe Burrow dominating the league.\nBecause the position is younger, many of these star players shared draft classes and were picked right in front or after each other in the NFL draft. Two quarterback draft classes stick out by each producing several of the most dominant players in the league.\nThe 2018 NFL quarterback class featured Baker Mayfield, Sam Darnold, Josh Allen, Josh Rosen, and Lamar Jackson. The 2020 NFL quarterback class featured Joe Burrow, Tua Tagovailoa, Justin Herbert, Jordan Love, and Jalen Hurts.\nThe quarterback position can take years to develop.

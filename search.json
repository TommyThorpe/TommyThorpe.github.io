    "section": "",
    "text": "The dual-threat quarterback has gone from a trend to a necessity in today’s NFL. Lamar Jackson may be the truest embodiment of the dual threat quarterback ever, which leads to a new question: Is he the greatest? \nA stigma against many dual threat quarterbacks is they naturally rely slightly less on their arms because of their talent and creativity they present with their legs. Jackson entered the 2018 draft with his critics discussing this exact situation. Some scouts and team officials even called for Jackson to switch to wide receiver so he could take full advantage of his athletic abilities. Would Jackson work out as an NFL quarterback?\n\nShort answer: he can. \n\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(janitor)\n\nrawqb &lt;- read_csv(\"qbs19752024.csv\")\n\n\ndualthreatqbs &lt;- rawqb |&gt; \n  filter(Player %in% c(\"Lamar Jackson\", \"Cam Newton\", \"Russell Wilson\", \"Steve Young\", \"John Elway\", \"Randall Cunningham\", \"Michael Vick\",\"Jalen Hurts\", \"Donovan McNabb\", \"Josh Allen\")) |&gt; \n  group_by(Player) |&gt; \n  arrange(desc(Player))\n\nnewdualthreat &lt;- dualthreatqbs |&gt; \n  group_by(Player) |&gt; \n  summarise(\n    CareerPassTD = sum(TD),\n    CareerInt = sum(Int)\n  ) |&gt; \n  mutate(CareerTDIntRatio = CareerPassTD/CareerInt) |&gt; \n  arrange(desc(CareerTDIntRatio))\n\nlj8 &lt;- newdualthreat |&gt; \n  filter(Player == \"Lamar Jackson\")\n\nggplot()+\n  geom_bar(data=newdualthreat, aes(x=reorder(Player, CareerTDIntRatio), weight=CareerTDIntRatio),fill=\"lightgrey\")+\n  geom_bar(data=lj8, aes(x=reorder(Player, CareerTDIntRatio), weight=CareerTDIntRatio), fill=\"purple\")+\n  coord_flip()+ \n  labs(\n    x=\"Player\", \n    y=\"Career Touchdown to Interception Ratio\", \n    title=\"Which dual-threat QB protects the ball best?\", \n    subtitle=\"Jackson's touchdown to interception ratio tops all of the other notable dual threat QBs\", \n    caption=\"Source: Pro Football Reference | By Thomas Thorpe\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal()+\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince his arrival in 2018, the Louisville product leads the dual threat classification passing touchdown to interception ratio: an important statistic that measures a quarterback’s best and worst deliverables. How often a quarterback can deliver a good result compared to a back one is an essential metric when evaluating their play.\n\nAlthough interception ratio is a fantastic measurable for quarterback play, there’s more to football than just touchdowns and turnovers. Sometimes a team just needs a standard first down. Sometimes a team just needs a clutch completion on third and long. How often a quarterback is completing passes is important to individual and team success and is one of the most common evaluating factors to quarterback play. \nJackson shows out compared to other dual threat quarterbacks.\n\n\nCode\ndualthreatqblarge &lt;- rawqb |&gt; \n  filter(Player %in% c(\"Lamar Jackson\", \"Cam Newton\", \"Russell Wilson\", \"Steve Young\", \"John Elway\", \"Randall Cunningham\", \"Michael Vick\",\"Jalen Hurts\", \"Donovan McNabb\", \"Justin Fields\", \"Kyler Murray\", \"Deshaun Watson\", \"Patrick Mahomes\", \"Aaron Rodgers\", \"Josh Allen\", \"Steve McNair\", \"Colin Kaepernick\")) |&gt; \n  group_by(Player) |&gt; \n  summarise(\n    CareerGames = sum(G),\n    CareerPassAtt = sum(Att),\n    CareerPassComp = sum(Cmp)\n  ) |&gt; \n  mutate(CareerCompPct = CareerPassComp/CareerPassAtt) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(Player))\n\nmurray &lt;- rawqb |&gt; \n  filter(Player == \"Kyler Murray\") |&gt; \n group_by(Player) |&gt; \n  summarise(\n    CareerGames = sum(G),\n    CareerPassAtt = sum(Att),\n    CareerPassComp = sum(Cmp)\n  ) |&gt; \n    mutate(CareerCompPct = CareerPassComp/CareerPassAtt) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(Player))\n\nrodgers &lt;- rawqb |&gt; \n  filter(Player == \"Aaron Rodgers\") |&gt; \n group_by(Player) |&gt; \n  summarise(\n    CareerGames = sum(G),\n    CareerPassAtt = sum(Att),\n    CareerPassComp = sum(Cmp)\n  ) |&gt; \n    mutate(CareerCompPct = CareerPassComp/CareerPassAtt) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(Player))\n\nlj8pass &lt;- rawqb |&gt; \n  filter(Player == \"Lamar Jackson\") |&gt; \n group_by(Player) |&gt; \n  summarise(\n    CareerGames = sum(G),\n    CareerPassAtt = sum(Att),\n    CareerPassComp = sum(Cmp)\n  ) |&gt; \n    mutate(CareerCompPct = CareerPassComp/CareerPassAtt) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(Player)) \n\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(\n    data=dualthreatqblarge, \n    aes(x=CareerGames, y=CareerCompPct), \n    color=\"grey\", \n    alpha=.7) + \n  geom_point(\n    data=lj8pass, \n    aes(x=CareerGames, y=CareerCompPct), \n    color=\"purple\")+\n  geom_point(\n    data=murray, \n    aes(x=CareerGames, y=CareerCompPct), \n    color=\"red\")+\n   geom_point(\n    data=rodgers, \n    aes(x=CareerGames, y=CareerCompPct), \n    color=\"darkgreen\")+\n  theme_minimal()+\n  labs(\n    x=\"Career Games\", \n    y=\"Completion Percentage\", \n    title=\"Who's the most efficient QB in the air?\", \n    subtitle=\"Jackson ranks fourth among completion percentage among dual-threat QBs.\", \n    caption=\"Source: Pro Football Reference | By Thomas Thorpe\"\n    )+\n   theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )+\n  geom_text(aes(x=125, y=.6490, label=\"Lamar Jackson\"), color=\"purple\")+\n  geom_text(aes(x=100, y=.6720, label=\"Kyler Murray\"), color=\"red\")+\n  geom_text(aes(x=240, y=.6575, label=\"Aaron Rodgers\"), color=\"darkgreen\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscussing rushing statistics is a must when evaluating and comparing dual threat quarterbacks. Not every dual threat quarterback is equal. Some run more than others. Some run longer than others. In order to equal this out, average yards per carry creates a baseline of what to expect every time these quarterbacks carry the football. \n\n\nCode\nqbrushnew &lt;- read_csv(\"qb_rushing_19752024.csv\")\n\n\nnewdualthreat &lt;- qbrushnew |&gt; \n  filter(player %in% c(\"Lamar Jackson\", \"Cam Newton\", \"Russell Wilson\",\"Michael Vick\",\"Donovan McNabb\", \"Jalen Hurts\", \"Josh Allen\")) |&gt; \n  group_by(player) |&gt; \n  summarise(\n    CareerRushAtt = sum(att),\n    CareerRushYds = sum(yds)) |&gt; \n  mutate(CareerYardsPerRush = CareerRushYds/CareerRushAtt) |&gt; \n  ungroup() |&gt; \n  arrange(desc(CareerYardsPerRush))\n\nnewdualthreat |&gt; \n  arrange(desc(CareerYardsPerRush)) |&gt; \n  gt() |&gt; \n  cols_label(\n    CareerRushAtt = \"Career Rush Attempts\",\n    CareerRushYds = \"Career Rush Yards\", \n    CareerYardsPerRush = \"Career Yards per Rush\"\n  ) |&gt; \n  tab_header(\n    title = \"Who's the most efficient dual-threat QB on the ground?\", \n    subtitle = \"Jackson finishes in second in career yards per carry.\"\n  )|&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", weight = \"bold\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"title\")\n  ) |&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"subtitle\")\n  )|&gt;\n  tab_source_note(\n    source_note = md(\"**By:** Thomas Thorpe  |  **Source:** Pro Football Reference\")\n  )|&gt;\n  tab_style(\n     locations = cells_column_labels(columns = everything()),\n     style = list(\n       cell_borders(sides = \"bottom\", weight = px(5)),\n       cell_text(weight = \"bold\", size=12)\n     )\n  )|&gt;\n  opt_row_striping() |&gt; \n  opt_table_lines(\"none\") |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"purple\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"white\")\n      ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = player == \"Lamar Jackson\")\n  ) |&gt; \n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_text(color = \"darkgrey\")\n      ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = player == \"Michael Vick, Donovan McNabb, Russell Wilson, Cam Newton, Jalen Hurts\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWho's the most efficient dual-threat QB on the ground?\n\n\nJackson finishes in second in career yards per carry.\n\n\nplayer\nCareer Rush Attempts\nCareer Rush Yards\nCareer Yards per Rush\n\n\n\n\nMichael Vick\n873\n6109\n6.997709\n\n\nLamar Jackson\n1014\n6173\n6.087771\n\n\nDonovan McNabb\n616\n3459\n5.615260\n\n\nJosh Allen\n759\n4142\n5.457181\n\n\nRussell Wilson\n1024\n5462\n5.333984\n\n\nCam Newton\n1118\n5628\n5.033989\n\n\nJalen Hurts\n674\n3133\n4.648368\n\n\n\nBy: Thomas Thorpe | Source: Pro Football Reference\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLamar Jackson nears the top of many passing and rushing statistics when compared to his dual threat peers.
